    	<p>
    	The secret of a good industrial chocolate leaves the quality of the chosen grain, its fermented and dried and is completed in its factory handling to achieve the desired flavor.
    	The process of roasting and drying as well as the additives (cane sugar, natural vanilla, ...) is what differentiates a good chocolate from an uninteresting chocolate.</p>

            <h2>Roasting:</h2>
            <p>The grain arrives at the factory and is cleaned. The beans are roasted or roasted in order to enhance flavor and color. The temperature, time and degree of humidity depend on the type of grain and what the artisan wants to achieve. If different types of seeds are used, roasting will be different for each variety.</p>

            <h2>Dehulling</h2>
            <p>A machine is used to dehull the grains and leave the cocoa seeds or pips. Currently these seeds are a product itself because some manufacturers use them to consume as is or as chopped into chocolate tablets (eclats de feves)</p>

            <h2>Ground</h2>
            <p>The mixture of grains in the desired proportions is milled in grinders at a temperature of 60 to 80 degrees and for a time between 18 and 72 hours. This process, taken care of by each craftsman, is important to obtain higher final quality. Cocoa liquor is obtained with this, a semi-solid mass which, at 40 degrees, already has a certain smell of chocolate and contains cocoa and cocoa butter.</p>

            <h2>Dutch powde</h2>
            <p>The cocoa butter is used in the manufacture of chocolate or is derived to the cosmetic industry (in Spain we speak of cocoa for the lips), medical, etc. for use in different products since its beneficial properties are highly appreciated.
            The cocoa cake is broken into fragments that are pulverized to form cocoa powder. Industrially distinguishes between cocoa powder and processed Dutch cocoa; In the latter, the cocoa beans are subjected to a process of alkalization, usually with potassium carbonate, to neutralize the acidity of the cocoa, giving a darker, redder colored powder. This processed Dutch cocoa is highly appreciated in confectionery</p>

            <h2>Tempering</h2>
            <p>The tempering is used to cool the mixture up to 40 degrees so that the crystallization of the cocoa butter is stable, passing it through a heating, cooling and reheating system. This prevents discoloration and blooming of fat in the product by preventing certain crystalline forms of developing cocoa butter. The chocolate is now bright and smooth, with a homogeneous texture.</p>
